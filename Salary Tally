* Week #: 7
* Problem #: 6.10
* Filename: <ch_6_10_joshua>.c
* Problem Description: Use a one-dimensional array to solve the 0following problem. 
* A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. 
* For example, a salesperson who grosses $3,000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $3,000, or a total of $470. Write a C program 
* (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges 
* (assume that each salespersonâ€™s salary is truncated to an integer amount):
*
*
*
* Notes: Making the logic work on this one took a little bit of time just because I had to get most of the print statements out of the the first loop
* I thentransfered them to the second loop which still didn't work so I ended up putting them after the second loop and they worked.
*
* Sample Output:
* Please enter the gross amount each of the 18 sales people earned this week.
Enter amount here 1 : $5000
Gross Salary 1 = $650

Enter amount here 2 : $3000
Gross Salary 2 = $470

Enter amount here 3 : $3000
Gross Salary 3 = $470

Enter amount here 4 : $5000
Gross Salary 4 = $650

Enter amount here 5 : $2000
Gross Salary 5 = $380

Enter amount here 6 : $2000
Gross Salary 6 = $380

Here is the number of how many salesmen earned each amount.
$200 - $299 : 0
$300 - $399 : 2
$400 - $499 : 2
$500 - $599 : 0
$600 - $699 : 2
$700 - $799 : 0
$800 - $899 : 0
$300 - $399 : 0
Over $1000 : 0
