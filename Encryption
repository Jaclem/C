* Week #: 6
* Problem #: 1-4a
* Filename: <clement_1-4a>.c
* 
* Problem Description: Write a program that will read a four-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt it as follows:
* Replace each digit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the new value by 10.
* Then swap the second digit with the fourth. Finally, print the original number and its encrypted one. Now reverse the process.
* Read an encrypted integer and decrypt it by reversing the algorithm to obtain the original number. Print out both the encrypted and decrypted integer.
*
*
* Notes: For this problem I took 4 seperate integers entered by the user and made 4 more integers that would be set equal to the users numbers after being being
* added by 7 and then divided by 10 and got the remainder. 
* 
*
* Sample Output:
* I will encrypt a password that you enter.
* Enter four seperate intergers making sure add a space after each number.
* 
* 1 2 3 4
*
* Your original number is
* 1 2 3 4
* 
* And your encrypted number is
* 0 1 8 9

	scanf_s("%d %d %d %d", &num1, &num2, &num3, &num4); // scanning those numbers into memory
	printf("\n"); // adding a space so that everything is easier to read.

	printf("Your original number is\n");
	printf("%d %d %d %d\n", num1, num2, num3, num4); // telling the user their original number they entered.
	printf("\n");

	enc1 = (num1 + 7) % 10;
	enc2 = (num2 + 7) % 10;
	enc3 = (num3 + 7) % 10;
	enc4 = (num4 + 7) % 10; // making each of the enc variables equal to a user entered variable + 7 and divided by 10 for their remainder.

	printf("And your encrypted number is\n");
	printf("%d ""%d ""%d ""%d", enc3, enc4, enc1, enc2); // telling the user what their encrypted number is.
	printf("\n"); // another space
