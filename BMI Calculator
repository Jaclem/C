* Student Name: Joshua Clement
* Submission Date: 10/25/18
*
* Week #: 6
* Problem #: 1-2
* Filename: <clement_1-2>.c
* Problem Description: Write a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI). 
*
*
* Notes: This problem was pretty straightforward once and once I made the interger for num = 0 I knew that I could make it equal to itself + 1 in the loop statement.
*
* Sample Output:
* Please enter your weight in pounds.
* 
* Now enter your height in feet.
*
* Now enter your height in inches.
*
* Your BMI is 24.3 and indicated by your weight you are in the Normal category
* Underweight: less than 18.5
* Normal : between 18.5 and 24.9
* Overweight : between 25 and 29.9
* Obese : 30 or greater
