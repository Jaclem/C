#include <stdio.h>

* Student Name: Joshua Clement
* Submission Date: 11/8/2018

* Week #: 6
* Problem #: 5.17
* Filename: <ch_3_22_joshua>.c
* Problem Description: Write a function isMultiple that determines for a pair of integers whether the second integer is a multiple of the first. 
* The function should take two integer arguments and return 1 (true) if the second is a multiple of the first, and 0 (false) otherwise.
*
*
* Notes: Looking back to a previous code written for chapter 2 was helpful for me to understand how to find out whether or not 
* one number was a multiple of another.
*
* Sample Output:
* Enter two integers and the program will tell you whether the second integer is a multiple of the first \n 1 for true 0 for false (n to end).
* 25 5
* 1
*

// function prototype 
int isMultiple(int x, int y);

main(void)
{

	int a, b;

	// prompting user to enter two integers
	printf("Enter two integers and the program will tell you whether the second integer is a multiple of the first \n 1 for true 0 for false (n to end).\n");
	
	scanf_s("%d %d", &a, &b);
	printf("", isMultiple(a, b));

}

// function definition
int isMultiple(int x, int y)
{
	int a = x, b = y;

	// initializing if else statement
	if (a % b == 0)
	{
		printf("1 (true)\n");
	}
	else
	{
		printf("0 (false)\n");
	}

	return b;
