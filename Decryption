* Student Name: Joshua Clement
* Submission Date: 10/25/18

* Week #: 6
* Problem #: 1-4b
* Filename: <clement_1-4b>.c
* Problem Description: Write a program that will read a four-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt it as follows:  
* Replace each digit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the new value by 10. 
* Then swap the second digit with the fourth. Finally, print the original number and its encrypted one. Now reverse the process. 
* Read an encrypted integer and decrypt it by reversing the algorithm to obtain the original number. Print out both the encrypted and decrypted integer.
*
*
* Notes: For this problem I just had to reverse the order of the encryption so by subtracting 7 at first instead of adding it (like in the encryption) then 
* make if else statements that determined if the number was positive after subtracting 7 to leave it alone, and if not then to add 10 and print the number.
*
* Sample Output:
* Now that I have encrypted the 4 intergers that were entered it's time to decrypt them.
* Enter the four encrypted intergers that were given in the encryption program.
* 0 1 8 9
* 
* This is the decrypted version of the encrypted interger that was entered.
* 1 2 3 4
